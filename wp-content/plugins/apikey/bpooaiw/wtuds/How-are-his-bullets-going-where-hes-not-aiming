His style depends on his first bullet accuracy a lot and if he&#39;s good at it, he would have probably carried his team a lot harder than now.

He meant (as far as I understood) that a demo is good enough to judge if a player is cheating, and referred to the debate on wether the flusha clips are good evidence or not (atleast I assumed so since he brought up tick-rate).

Aug 8, 2017 Travis Trice no longer has Torrey Craig as a teammate but he&#39;s still determined to help turn the Brisbane Bullets into a force But while the plan has altered with Craig having gone to chase his NBA dream with the Denver Nuggets, Trice&#39;s end goal remains the same – turning the Bullets into an NBL force.

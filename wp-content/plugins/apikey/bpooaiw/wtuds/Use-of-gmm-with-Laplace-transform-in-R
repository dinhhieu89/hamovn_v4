Tauchen constant, equal to the Log-Laplace transform of νT , equivalent to the image of ν.  We call this new type of integral an improper integral because the in- terval of integration is infinite, violating an assumption we made when originally developing the Laplace transforms are often used to solve differen- tial equations.

Not gonna go through all of sanji fights.  you cant imagine luffy&#39;s bounty rise yet zoro still in his bounty now.  Brook is the only member of the SH pirates that did not show their youth? Brook is not the first skeleton(that can move and talk), who appeared in One Piece? there was a non-canon Captain Joke.  What I disliked: On reflection that Hody didn&#39;t defeat himself rather than by Luffy punching him a lot.  I think he may be the one who comfirms to the WG that Moria was beaten by Luffy (of course, it COULD be another Aokiji-type situation where Luffy fights a super-strong opponent Correct me if I&#39;m misunderstanding you marvelB, but the crew defeated Oz?! The way you said it made me think that they did.  &quot;Pedro said we can worry about it later,&quot; Nami said as she looked at the map Pudding drew for them.  Nice how Oda working his One shot &quot;Monsters&quot; into the One Piece story.  5 Jul 2017this List is ass u didn&#39;t even put KAIDO because hes top 5 luffy should be In Top 30 sabo One piece.  5 yıl önce.  &quot;Can Luffy beat Kaido at his current level.  Hey, Dvampire, I&#39;m going to post a theory in the DBZ thread soon< </div>

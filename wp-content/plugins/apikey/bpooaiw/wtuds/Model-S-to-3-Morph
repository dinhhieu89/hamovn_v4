The architecture of the model morphing approach supports reuse.  Also, I will discuss how to extend of the basic morphing algorithm to handle 3-D models, a fea- ture absent in most available commercial packages.  Section 4 defines the cross- parameterization function between the models.  Several different types of stock assessment models are used to provide scientific advice to managers about exploited populations.

The approach presented in the previous section enables a single morph decoding to yield two sets of lattices: a morph and word.  Current techniques for creating such models require a sig- nificant amount of time and effort, making them infeasible or im- practical.

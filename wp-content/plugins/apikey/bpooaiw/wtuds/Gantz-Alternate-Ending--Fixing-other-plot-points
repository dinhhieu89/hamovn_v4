			<div class="odd"> It explained things, just obviously not everything.  A great example was Taking into account the earlier creation of the Gantz suits, a huge alien invasion to end the series, in theory, works.  POST Production The test was designed to compare the general performance of two different programs running on different machines — the Apple He was altered with a&nbsp; Animation &middot; After being brutally murdered in a subway station, a teen boy awakens to find himself resurrected by a strange computer named Gantz, and forced to fight a large force of invading aliens in Osaka.  I confess that this is not a rare experience as many who have picked up Gantz reacted in a similar way - they can&#39;t put it down.  Almost all of the main characters he introduced were killed (except for the two it all originally started with and one or two others), you don&#39;t see that often and I&#39;m glad he did it like that.  this fucker, Makoto [​IMG] He may look nice, but the things this fool does is ridiculously.  2.  Nishi one of the other survivors then tells them that they will return here in regular intervals to hunt aliens and that they are most likely copies of their original selves.  Gonzo needed a way to end the series and created a weird introspective fight yourself battle.  ADAM B.  Another one is removal of the explanation for a plot element without which the plot element&nbsp; 20 Jan 2013 The manga and the anime diverge during the anime&#39;s last battle. This is an overview and an alternate ending / alternate explanation I came up with for the plot while still staying true to the original lore and 7 Dec 2017 As the story progressed over the years, the plot lines became more and more complicated until the story stopped making sense in certain places.  I also recommend anyone who did not get any bit of&nbsp; 2 Jul 2013 My mind filled with contents I wouldn&#39;t wish to others unless they&#39;d agree to it.  18 Dec 2017 I just finished watching Gantz: O and my god I forgot how utterly addictive the concept of Gantz really is.  The last battle in the anime never occurred in the manga.  Makoto is a first year high school student, and the &quot;protagonist&quot;, he meets and starts going out with this girl named Katsura, but realizes he&#39;s into his other friend&nbsp; JOHN GANTZ.  They then go home and Kurono has difficulty&nbsp; 9 Sep 2016 is a frequently used defense of subpar film adaptations, but here&#39;s hoping Keiichi Sato and Yasushi Kawamura&#39;s computer-generated “Gantz: O” represents a departure from the original “Gantz” comic (written by Hiroya Oku, adapted for screen by Tsutomu Kuroiwa).  That&#39;s just me&nbsp; 23 Feb 2013 If the manga would not conclude by the time their allotted season ends, they usually create an alternate ending, so that the audience does not feel like they . .  GREEN Production Manager KARIN POWELL Pasteup Supervisor RACHEL E.  Have there been any news or talks of finally adapting the manga&nbsp; 2 Jul 2013 They explained the origin of the Gantz ball, the aliens, etc.  Much like those freakishly bizarre aliens.  The manga went on with more battles and more characters, ongoing for a long time, and I&nbsp; 1 Aug 2014 heres the gizz of the plot (btw, this is a Harem anime). WASSER Pasteup Artist MARGARET M.  I think I finished the anime like 6 years ago so I really haven&#39;t read anything about the series since then, so that brings me to this question.  Do you actually want this to be handed to you.  28 May 2017 Anyone know why did it end? G had interesting characters and fixed most of the authors flaws from Gantz.  since they skipped everything involving how a ghoul&#39;s body works, they had to make Quinque steel surgical implements a anime-original plot point,&nbsp; It then beats Masaru and then starts chasing Kurono before they manage to take it down and end the mission.  Another aspect of&nbsp; The ending like the entire series requires you to connect alot of different peices together.  Otherwise it suggests strongly that all&nbsp; Naturally, restarting the story at this point would have to involve either: a) an extreme tangent to the original material, or b) abandoning the plot so far and starting up an Alternate Compare Adaptational Alternate Ending, where the original work did finish its ending before the adaptation but was changed for other reasons.  While adapting a story to a new medium, the adaption team made a wrong assumption about a future Plot Point and added a detail which was later contradicted by the creator of the source material (compare Overtook the Manga).

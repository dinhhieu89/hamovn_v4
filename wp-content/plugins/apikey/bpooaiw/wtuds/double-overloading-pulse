A hard tip has a very short pulse and will excite a wide frequency range.  a maximum of 1 V peak, and were amplified by 20 dB using a custom-built battery-driven power amplifier to avoid overloading of the D/As when driving the hydrophones.  When we use more suitable equipment (6x4 trucks and triple axle semi-trailers), we risk going beyond the Maximum Gross Vehicle Weight.  Overload with the side, kill with the front.  Another concern of overload response is that after the output stage Q3 is cut off, the negative going output ef&#39;Q2 can couple through the collector base capacity of Q3_ This can produce a notch in the output signal and, hence, a second positive going edge to trigger the discriminator.

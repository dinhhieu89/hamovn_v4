NaN is of number type. all is an object, but it is undefined; Minimal value is greater .  Any loose or strict comparisons of this value against any other value, including itself, but except TRUE , will have a result of FALSE .  Try it Yourself ».  The snag Returns true if the argument coerces to NaN, and otherwise returns false.  It does not cast it&#39;s input through Number(value) before comparision. ok( &quot;&quot;, &quot;empty string fails&quot; ); assert.  What&#39;s happening here isn&#39;t quite magic—the expression is simply being lazily evaluated.  This is what is commonly referred to as truthy versus falsey. NaN); Number.  For that reason, values like 8, “abc”, undefined, and nil are “truthy” or&nbsp; 21 Jul 2013 In the REPL: ClojureScript:cljs.  JavaScript has three special numeric values: Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN. ok( NaN, &quot;NaN fails&quot; ); assert.  NaN is a JavaScript exposes the isNaN method for checking for NaN values. 9.  false. 1 Some of the attribute values are &quot;Null&quot; (aka 1.  Within pandas, a missing value is denoted by NaN .  . isNaN(100); // Returns false.  NaN&nbsp; If the division has no remainder, the modulus operation will return zero (0); for example, 4 % 2 will return 0 .  things that evaluate like true would in certain positions (e.  if false, 0, &quot;&quot;, &#39;&#39;, null, undefined, NaN) if(!a) { // do something }.  The official documentation for pandas defines what most developers would know as null values as missing or missing data in pandas.  What&#39;s weirder?

[[Prototype]] of objects are&nbsp; 2 Sep 2014 When the function above is executed we will get the alert Huh? because the value of the variable hello is being evaluated to be false. bignumber(0)); // returns false math.  There are three ways any value can be converted to a boolean:&nbsp; 18 Jan 2017 The global isNaN function converts its argument to the type Number before the comparison, which can lead to non-number values returning true JavaScript.  A number 0 , an empty string &quot;&quot; , null , undefined and NaN become false .  The Number type is the set of all possible Number values, which includes the primitive values NaN (Not-a-Number), positive infinity, and negative infinity. log([NaN,1,NaN,2,1,4,NaN]. ok( null,&nbsp; In this tutorial, you will learn how to use JavaScript logical operators including logical NOT (!)

In JavaScript, can easily test for a number by doing typeof value === &#39;number&#39; .  There are some related things, such as constants and comparisons for infinity.  null, always, never. log(&#39;&#39; == 0); // And these do too! if ({}) // if but since we&#39;re talking about type coercion and comparisons – it&#39;s worth mentioning that comparing NaN with anything (even NaN !) will always return false .  The value NaN in JavaScript stands for “not a number”.  A common use of isNaN( ) is to test the results of parseFloat( ) and parseInt( ) to determine if they represent legal numbers. &quot; What does &quot;loosely&quot; mean in this context? There are two comparison operators to test According to the first chart, NaN, null, undefined, and {} are not falsy, because they don&#39;t equal false in a loose comparison.  This means that if we put one of these values as the condition of a conditional statement we will always get a failing statement.  In JavaScript a variable exists in the scope of a function and that variable can be defined anywhere in the function.  !!&quot;&quot; // false !!0 // false !!null // false !!undefined // false !!NaN // false !!&quot;hello&quot; // true !!1 // true !! I&#39;ve been searching all day for a simple way to check if something is truthy or falsy and this did it for me in a heartbeat.  What&#39;s going on here? In JavaScript, NaN has the distinction of being the only value that is not equal to itself.  (i.  Lets consider some examples.  Undefined (a variable with no defined value); Null (a single null value); Boolean (true or false); Number (this includes Infinity and NaN – not a number!) false; 0 (zero); &#39;&#39; or &quot;&quot; (empty string); null; undefined; NaN (e. ok( false, &quot;false fails&quot; ); assert.  Joc. log(3/0===4/0); // true. js: A Hands-On Guide to Building Web Applications in JavaScript.  Boolean conversion However, in Dart, the above will not print because name is converted to false due to boolean conversion. isNaN(math.  This means that when you attempt to compare something to NaN , the condition will always evaluate to false .  This introduction attempts to explain JavaScript to those with prior programming experience in Java, and will point out some common mistakes along the way. log(&quot;5&quot; - 1); returns: // ▻ 4; console. grep ) and other JS frameworks.  &quot;false&quot; console.  It&#39;s sort&nbsp; 21 Feb 2017 The typeof operator in JavaScript evaluates and returns a string with the data type of an operand.  Why is this needed? This library provides a fast, simple way of checking whether a value is a number, whether defined as a string or number by the user.  a number), despite being assigned through boolean operators: console.  boolean, false, true. log(null || NaN || undefined || false || 0 || 10); // outputs: 10.  if the 0 is immediately followed by digit, then the number literal is evaluated in octal base 8 instead of decimal base 10 , so that 0100 === 100 is false and 0100 === 64 is true .  It mainly indicates that parsing a string has gone wrong: &gt; Number(&quot;xyz&quot;) NaN NaN&nbsp; 31 Mar 2015 console.

So for those (hopefully rare) situations when you&#39;re&nbsp; 17 Mar 2009 The isNaN() function (NaN stands for Not a Number) can be useful if you are looking at form inputs or similar and is used to detect if a value is not a number.  For example, 0 (zero) is falsey, but new Number(0) is truthy.  All other values of JavaScript can be safely assumed to be truthy values.  4 Jan 2016 It is worth mentioning that NaN in identity (and in equality) operator compared with any other value always evaluates to false .  NaN.  22 Aug 2017 Anything in JavaScript can be considered either truthy or falsy.  Another difference between value and reference types is .  A reference type variable holds a reference to the value whose length is not fixed and can be of any size.

This post looks at two special values that can be the result of operations that normally return numbers: NaN and Infinity.  To fix this error, as the message suggests, you can use the isNaN function, which is a built-in&nbsp; 7 Feb 2012 JavaScript has six other falsey values such as empty string, zero, null object, undefined, or NaN.  But a custom sort does not: console.  Furthermore we can&nbsp; If the argument evaluates to true, the assertion passes; otherwise, it fails. ) But then fnenu asked, &quot;What if you set those values to variables, does it still evaluate to false?&quot; This is an excellent question, so I ran another test:.  By converting a value into strict Boolean data type, we can check whether it evaluates to truthy or falsy.  Another tidbit about&nbsp; Although null is a data type, the typeof operator will evaluate this type as an object.  // Returns true.  “Not a number” is type of “number”.  Therefore, use Number. js platform and build server-side applications with extraordinary&nbsp; The following example does not throw an AssertionError because the properties on the RegExp object are not enumerable: // WARNING: This does not Set and Map values, Map keys and NaN are compared using the SameValueZero comparison (which means they are free of the caveats). log(8 * null); returns: // ▻ 0; console.

There are three .  To find out more about In JavaScript following items evaluate to false in a conditional statement: undefined, null, false, empty string, NaN, 0.  Here it returns the actual object , not a true / false .  In fact NaN is not&nbsp; This function is required because comparing a NaN with any value, including itself, always returns false , so it is not possible to test for NaN with the == or === operators.  +0 is equal to 0 , and the algorithm returns false .  The logical thing to do is check whether the result is equal to NaN .  In Dart, if an object is not the boolean value true, it is evaluated as false.  Unlike all other possible values in JavaScript, it is not possible to rely on the equality operators (== and ===) to determine whether a value is NaN or not, This means that in JavaScript, isNaN(x) == true is equivalent to x - 0 returning NaN (though in JavaScript x - 0 == NaN always returns false, so you can&#39;t test for it).  Where a Boolean is expected, Ruby evaluates nil as false, JavaScript evaluates NaN as false.  Converting To Boolean.  That is, NaN is not equal to, greater than, or less than anything, including itself: NaN &lt; 1; // false NaN &gt; 1; // false NaN == NaN; // false // But we can still check for NaN: isNaN(NaN); // true.  &quot;non-empty string succeeds&quot; ); assert. 5 which will be truncated to 0 since the counter i is an integer and the condition 1/2 &gt; 0 will evaluate to false. log(&quot;five&quot; * 2); returns: // ▻ NaN; console. log(NaN===NaN); // false console.  Most languages For instance, 1 / 2 evaluates 0 in C++ and Java, due to integer rounding, but in JavaScript it revaluates to 0.  Several operations can var x = Math. 12:.  JavaScript also has NaN (not a number) and Infinity , which are returned by some computations: JavaScript Tutorial: BuiltIn Types.  number, 0 NaN, any other number. log(false == &#39;0&#39;); console. ok( 0, &quot;0 fails&quot; ); assert.  Indeed.  All of these evaluate to &#39;true&#39;! console.  20 Sep 2016 boolean-false In JavaScript, certain values and types are considered “falsy”: 0, “”, NaN, null and undefined are all “falsy” values. 0 but there will be warning 3590 thrown out in strict mode as the data type of NaN is still Number.  If the result is true , Line 11 prints &quot;Hello, username!&quot; .  any value it is given into an number, which means that &quot;&quot; and null get converted to 0 and the function returns false because they are now numbers.  17 Jan 2016 Time to head into the JavaScript console and check NaN out in a bit more detail.  JavaScript has a number of data primitives, and the first we will look at is the number.  Hence, null &gt; 0; // false and null &lt; 0; // also false&nbsp; If y is NaN, return false.  Recently I was doing string casting to a number and while you think it&#39;s simple as it is, it took me a bit to make it fully functional.  But Boolean logic Number, Javascript, 0 and NaN are false; else: true.  The values 0 , NaN , &quot;&quot; (the empty string), null and undefined all evaluate to false.  Yeah.  Maybe that&#39;s return false.  0 , NaN → false.  An empty string, null, undefined, NaN, 0, -0, and false itself evaluate to the Boolean value false.  Since NaN is unordered, a numeric comparison operation involving one or two NaNs returns false and any != comparison involving NaN returns true, including x!=x when x is&nbsp; We&#39;re going to look at what logical operators are, what “truthy” and “falsy” mean, and how to use this to write cleaner, faster and more optimized javascript.  The following values are considered by JavaScript to be falseys: Empty string: &quot;&quot;; 0; null; undefined; NaN.

This occurs when a variable string or boolean type can not be converted into a number.  If a good value still can&#39;t be found, then the value NaN is set. isNaN() or global isNaN() functions to test whether a value is NaN . IsNaN(value) returns true if the value is a NaN.  &#39;&#39; → false.  This section covers the basic concepts of JavaScript, as well as some frequent pitfalls for people who have not used JavaScript before.  19 Aug 2016 According to the IEEE 754 floating-point standard, comparison with NaN always returns an unordered result.  29 Aug 2014 Sensible.  So NaN itself will return the property of NaN, which is what you would Here we are checking that the variable notANumber does not equal itself, so as NaN == NaN returns false we can check that NaN !== NaN&nbsp; JavaScript has a concept of truthy i.  return value; } var filtered = arr.  //For example, 2, &quot;string&quot;, true, will all return, but false, NaN, -1 will not.  View Course var isEven = function(number){ if(number%2===0){return true;} else if(isNaN(number)){ return &quot;Input is not a number&quot;;} else{return false;} }; .  Any value can be interpreted as a boolean value.  The modulus In JavaScript, for these operations, false is treated as 0 and true is treated as 1.  You probably saw Inside JavaScript, there are a few things that go on before (&quot;0&quot; == false) is evaluated.  It is an anonymous function expression that is immediately invoked, and it has some particularly important uses in JavaScript.  An object. log(&quot; \t\r\n&quot; == 0); console.  It&#39;s the best way to remember the strict comparison algorithm.  &gt; let pippo Welcome to javascript This would require a bigger explanation, however JS does a type cohercion trying to compare things.  2 Nov 2010 map &amp; filter , which are very useful.  true (always!) Manually Converting to Boolean. sqrt(-2); var y = Math.  Example 1 1 === &quot;1&quot; // false, IEA rule 1. &quot; (You should totally watch that, btw.  Neither of the values are NaN so we can skip Steps 6 and 7.  In the case of C, any expression that evaluates to zero is interpreted to be false.  Maks Nemisj | javascript | 0.  The Boolean value of NaN is false: var x = 10 / &quot;H&quot;; Boolean(x); // returns false.  All other values (non-falsy or truthy) evaluate to boolean true . isNaN(NaN); Number. log(null == undefined); console.  That said, what we&#39;re doing is evaluating non-Boolean values as Boolean. NaN is different than its global counterpart.  Values such as undefined , null , false , 0 , NaN and empty strings evaluate&nbsp; It defines the primitive types, undefined, null, Number, String and Boolean, which leads into an explanation of which values evaluate into true and.  A quick way to do this is to use the negation operator ( ! ): var a; // a = undefined // if falsy (i.  Same as input (nothing to convert).  In this case, b is false , the logical AND operator doesn&#39;t need to evaluate the second expression because it can determine the final result as false based on the truth table above.  My full code is&nbsp; 28 Dec 2015 Be aware: JavaScript will try to accept any program given to it, even very odd programs: console.  This statement will evaluate to true if a user is signed in, and false if a user is not.  other numbers → true.  In the second chart, ” ” (white space), [], and&nbsp; Emptiness in JavaScript is not as clear cut as in more strictly typed languages, but we can probably agree on some if not most of the following criteria: It&#39;s easy enough to avoid the falsiness ambiguity by comparing variables to the boolean false, but in terms of testing for emptiness, you may have to tailor your code to be as&nbsp; 25 May 2016 If applied to boolean values, the &amp;&amp; operator only returns true when both of its operands are true (and false in all other cases), while the || operator only returns false when both of its operands Also, the logical operators do not always return a boolean value, as the specification points out in section 12.  This book brings together the knowledge and JavaScript code you need to build master the Node.  Trailing commas (sometimes called &quot;final commas&quot;) can be useful when adding new elements, parameters, or properties to JavaScript code.  When used in a logical context, 0, -0, null, NaN, undefined, and the empty string (&quot;&quot;) evaluate as false due to automatic type coercion.  It will be converted to a boolean value, if necessary.  All these types and their&nbsp; 12 Jan 2017 Values such as false , null , undefined , NaN , 0 , &#39;&#39; and &quot;&quot; are considered as falsy.  Should NaN not be a number? I found this because I was using parseInt returns NaN for non-numbers.  If a second message argument is provided, it will be displayed in place of the result. isNaN(Number.  A boolean.  Any other data type will automatically be coerced into it&#39;s corresponding boolean value when&nbsp; 11 Aug 2009 The following values will evaluate to false , while all others will evaluate to true : 0 or -0 (Most floating-point implementations have positive and negative zero, due to the IEEE 754 standard); null; undefined; NaN; The empty string (“”); false itself.  I wonder what the type of null is … js&gt; .  undefined, always, never.  Values that evaluate to false 0; &#39;&#39;; // an empty string NaN; // JavaScript&#39;s &quot;not-a-number&quot; primitive null; undefined; // be careful -- undefined can be redefined! Values that evaluate to true &#39;0&#39;; // because it&#39;s a string &#39;a string&#39;;&nbsp; 24 May 2013 NET framework already provides simple ways to achieve this.  For objects&nbsp; 30 Apr 2014 In terms of how Ruby and JavaScript evaluate certain values, yes.  With the excepting of the special numeric value NaN (Not a Number) which is used when another type is converted to a number but that conversion does not result in a meaningful number.  This is because NaN returns false for any&nbsp; 1 Nov 2009 You should use === instead, because [as3]null == undefined; // true null === undefined; // false.  All other&nbsp; If a return statement returns a value, that value expression must begin on the same line as the return : return { status: true }; .  For example, the expression parseInt(&#39;aaa&#39;) == parseInt(&#39;bbb&#39;) evaluates to false.  NaN =&gt; NaN.  something === NaN //Does not work, always false NaN === NaN //false.  string, &#39;&#39; (empty string), any other string.  In JavaScript sometimes values that seem like they should evaluate one way actually evaluate another.  Gary Bernhardt === GOLD.  Those two NaN values are not equal because they are not necessarily the same unrepresentable number.  But sometimes that&#39;s not enough.  False JavaScript Values (JSFiddle).  We don&#39;t need to evaluate against &quot;=== 0&quot; because anything other than 0 will evaluate to &quot;true&quot; for our &quot;if&quot;. log(!!undefined); // &quot;false&quot; Conversely, in numeric contexts null behaves as 0 while undefined causes the whole expression to evaluate as NaN.  null gets converted to +0 and 0 remains 0 . 5 . ). log(&quot;5&quot; + 1); returns: // ▻ 51; console.  Generally, any arithmetic operation with NaN or undefined as an input will have NaN as an output.  But, it turns out to be wrong.  If it is falsy, false is returned; it does not bother to evaluate the right operand.  Try it Yourself »&nbsp; 12 Oct 2016 How long will it run? It&#39;s not difficult to see that it will stop after the first iteration.  If they are of the same type an intuitive equality test is applied: object identifiers must reference the same object, strings must contain identical character sets, other primitives must share the same value.  The typeof operator returns the string &quot;boolean&quot; for these primitive types. isNaN([2, 0, -3, NaN]&#39;); // returns [false, false, false,&nbsp; Two literals are defined for boolean values: true and false.  Even an empty function, empty array and empty objects are also truthy.  Now what is NaN.  fails because NaN === NaN produces false . user&gt; (integer? js/NaN) false. sort(function(a,b) { return a - b; }));// [NaN,1,2,4,NaN,1,NaN].  My point was just that NaN === NaN evaluating to true would be just as &quot;correct&quot; (or incorrect) as if it evaluated to false from a pure logic perspective.  A quick tip to remove all falsy ( false , null , undefined , 0 , NaN or an empty string) items out of an&nbsp; 2 Sep 2017 If you are curious about those, you can find them here. 3) behaves in exactly the same way.  Or you could try to write in this way: var whatWillThisBe:Boolean = Boolean(numberOfDogs); More on Control Flow in JS Forum. user&gt; (number? js/NaN) true ClojureScript:cljs.  Comparing Falsy and Truthy&nbsp; There is the if statement for that and also the conditional (ternary) operator for conditional evaluation which we will be referring as the “question mark” The “if” statement gets a condition, evaluates it and, if the result is true , executes the code.  21 Jun 2017 NaN isn&#39;t equivalent to anything, even another NaN! let thisVar = (NaN == null); // false let thatVar = (NaN == NaN); // false.  It is described&nbsp; Some numeric operations can result in a value represented by the constant NAN .  NAN != NAN and NAN !== NAN) Examples of operations that produce NAN include sqrt(-1), asin(2), and&nbsp; 4 Nov 2011 Now, JavaScript variables aren&#39;t typed, so a variable may be assigned a value (e.  As Number(&#39;Red&#39;) , Number(&#39;$200&#39;) and Number(&#39;white&#39;) give NaN all, comparing function compare returns NaN when they compare to any other&nbsp; 22 Feb 2013 The return statement “does not see” that it has something to return (; are optional in JavaScript) so it returns nothing… 1 * &#39;foo&#39;; //NaN 1 * 2; //2 &#39;foo&#39; * 1; //NaN &#39;foo&#39; + 1; //&#39;foo1&#39;.  For Boolean data types, false will&nbsp; There are only six falsy values in JavaScript: undefined, null, NaN, 0, “” (empty string), and false of course.  1 day ago Be careful when working with NaN as this value behaves in an unexpected way – it is the only value in javascript that is not equal to itself, that means you cannot test that something is NaN by.  My first approach was to use a Number constructor for casting, which would return number or NaN if value was not parsable to the number.  The ! operator, on the other hand, is defined for boolean values only.  Comparisons evaluate to true and false , just like in Java: → 1 != . isNaN(0); // returns false math.  Any other Object including empty&nbsp; Because NaN is unique in JavaScript by not being equal to anything, including itself, the results of comparisons to NaN are confusing: NaN === NaN or NaN == NaN evaluate to false; NaN !== NaN or NaN != NaN evaluate to true.  undefined.  To really An empty string ( &#39;&#39; ), the number 0 , null , NaN , a boolean false , and undefined variables are all “falsy”.  We also have the NaN type (Not a number). log(NaN == NaN) // → false NaN is supposed to denote the result of a nonsensical computation,&nbsp; 11 Oct 2017 I answered true.  It&#39;s a value which a variable of type Number can hold meaning that it holds something which is not a number.  If we use: {} + {} //NaN As I mentioned “” is false so ! 29 Oct 2009 A basic quiz about JavaScript.  other strings → true.  Let&#39;s break it down.  You thought null being an object was ridiculous? Try dealing with the idea of NaN — “not a number” — being a number! Moreover, NaN is not considered equal to itself! Does your head hurt yet? alert(typeof NaN); //alerts &#39;Number&#39; alert(NaN === NaN); //evaluates false.  In other words, it returns true only if the argument is really NaN: 19 Oct 2011 There are only six falsey values in JavaScript: undefined , null , NaN , 0 , &quot;&quot; (empty string), and false , of course.  20 Jun 2015 Type Casting Shorthands. isNaN(0 / 0); // Returns false.  I don&#39;t know why this&nbsp; 21 Jan 2014 In JavaScript, the following values are considered to be falsy values: false; 0; null; “” (empty string); NaN (Not a Number); #ff0000.  A number.  You can use the Boolean() function to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true: guessed it) false: var x = false; Boolean(x); // returns false.  String, Ruby Knowing the truthiness and falsiness of various types in your languages of choice is important--you can see it&#39;s easy to get tripped up when transitioning! In this lesson, we&#39;ll get ourselves acquainted with two important keywords in Javascript: - NaN - Infinity.  &quot;Scratchy&quot;) // → true There is only one value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself, and that is NaN, which stands for “not a number”.  console.  For example, typeof NaN returns number , and there are&nbsp; jQuery is built on top of JavaScript, a rich and expressive language in its own right.  All other values evaluate to true .  We will look a lot&nbsp; These operations return either a true or false value: Boolean expressions in JavaScript return true or false values like the following: var a; a -&gt; undefined // undefined is the value a variable has before we assign it a value a + a; -&gt; NaN // using undefined in a calculation does NOT give an error a = 2; a; -&gt; 2 3 + a; -&gt; 5 a&nbsp; 2 Nov 2013 When comparing, a - b is calculated in compare so that every element in everything is converted to Number when comparing and then do the minus operation.  All other values evaluate to true, including true, the string &#39;false&#39;, and all objects. log(-1); console.  All other values (the complement of the previous&nbsp; JavaScript&#39;s primitive data types are boolean, number, and undefined; its reference types are string, object (including the null object), and function.  JavaScript provides an isNaN function that can distinguish between numbers and NaN : isNaN(NaN) // true isNaN(0) // false isNaN(&#39;oops&#39;) // true isNaN(&#39;0&#39;) // false. fraction(-2, 5)); // returns false math.  And then, I was like, &quot;WAT.  If a is NaN , the result is true.  null.  TRY: Instead of printing the greeting message using document.  The above expression evaluates to false.  See Also Is there a standard function to check for null, undefined, or blank variables in JavaScript? is equal ![] true is false; baNaNa; NaN is not a NaN; It&#39;s a fail; [] is truthy, but not true; null is falsy, but not false; document.  NaN // true.  This is why&nbsp; 7 Feb 2011 If the operands are of different types the answer is always false.  NaN states for Not a Number. NaN returns if the Global isFinite will evaluate non-numbers as finite! No casting to Number() is done, so you can be sure non-numbers like null will evaluate false. 0 if(a == &quot;um&quot;){} // Will return false, because is evaluated as NaN.  Now what do you think will happen if we&nbsp; 7 Feb 2013 The false values in JavaScript: false; null; undefined; The empty string ”; The number 0; The number NaN (result of an operation that cannot produce a normal result).  You can use isNaN or Number.  On the second iteration the counter i will be increased to 2 , 1/2 will produce 0.  Note that the abstract equality operator == will coerce the arguments to be of the same Type according to the rules for the Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm.  The value passed as a parameter may be of any type.  All is as expected, the last example shows simple string concatenation.  If you need to support older browsers, which you probably do, this filtering method can be also found in MooTools ( Array#filter ), jQuery ( $.  A string.  In JS++ In JavaScript, an arithmetic expression that evaluates to undefined or NaN results in NaN for the result. bignumber(NaN)); // returns true math. log(equalsNaN);.  30 May 2011 NaN is a Number. log(x == y); // false. log(false == 0); returns: // ▻ true; The heuristics for type&nbsp; 7 Jul 2014 This excerpt features materials from the following products: Learning Node.  var divisionByZod = 42 / &quot;General Zod&quot;; var equalsNaN = (divisionByZod === NaN); // Outputs: false console. filter(truthy); //This is filtering only the values that evaluate as true in the given array (following the&nbsp; Yes, NaN can be evaluated as false in Actionsscript 3.  In addition to &quot;number&quot;, the typeof operator can return one of 6 potential results - typeof 123 false. NaN if you need to actually generate a NaN in code, and float.

You have to buy the CISCO IOS file for your desired platform and use it in the lab enviroment for educational purposes.  What is important is the gateway IP of the NAT interface and the configuration of the interface on the network object from which you are trying to ping.  The cloud device icon in the GNS can be found either under Browse End Devices or&nbsp; 17 Aug 2016 Running vEOS and GNS3 locally on one box The last way we can run vEOS and GNS3 is all on one box.  To do this, follow the same steps as before, the only different is to omit the part where we check off Use GNS3 Server and when you&nbsp; could affect the accuracy and performance of all GPS equipment.
